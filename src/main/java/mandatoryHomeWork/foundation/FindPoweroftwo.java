	 * Given an integer n, return true if it is a power of two. Otherwise, return false.

An integer n is a power of two, if there exists an integer x such that n == 2x.
Example 1:

Input: n = 1
Output: true
Explanation: 20 = 1


Example 2:

Input: n = 16
Output: true
Explanation: 24 = 16

	 /*Read the integer
	 //Initialize output = n; //16
	/* check with while(n%2==0) and if whether the given number is completely divided by 2 (output/2
	 )
	 */
	 /* reinitialize output as 4
	 * output 2
	 * check if there is any reminder
	 *
